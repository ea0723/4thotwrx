##Welcome to my Intergalactic Planetary Credits Converter on Cloud9 IDE!

The easiest way to view / edit / and run this code is by going to the live Cloud9 ide:

* https://ide.c9.io/ea0723/4thtwrx
* in the top menubar, click run project 
* next, click Preview > Preview with Web Server
* this will open a new tab within this frame - you can break it into a new browser tab by clicking the pop-out icon on the top-right of the url bar.

Alternatively, please unzip this tar.gz file and open with RubyMine, Sublime Text, or a similar IDE.

Enjoy and thank you for the opportunity to create something fun and challenging!

##The Problem I Chose (from my perspective), and Why I Chose to Solve It
After the latest financial collapse, I've decided to give up on finding economic security on Earth. Luckily, the scant sum of money that was left in my account, 
was just enough for me to become an intergalactic entrepreneur. I rented a 
spaceship, left earth, and now make a living flying all over the galaxy selling 
common metals and dirt (which, apparently, is worth a lot).

However, buying and selling across the galaxy requires that I am able to convert numbers and units, and I've decided to write a program to do this. My hope is that my knowledge of intergalactic currency conversions will ultimately offer Earth the opportunity to regain some economic standing and join the Galactic Council.

The numbers used for intergalactic transactions follow a convention similar to the roman numerals, and I have painstakingly collected the appropriate translation between them.

##My Design and Coding Goals and Assumptions
In writing this application, my goals were to ensure my code was as DRY and simple as possible, including the interface, in order to maintain practicality and usability.

The ux / ui is simple and straightforward, while still maintaining humanity through the use of light humor.

My assumptions were that: 

* the user would have a knowledge of the appropriate input (test input)
* the person downloading the tar.gz file will know what an IDE is and how to use it
* the user is familiar with the book "The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy" by Douglas Adams
