Welcome to my Rails project on Cloud9 IDE!

The easiest way to view / edit / and run this code is by going to the live Cloud9 ide:

* https://ide.c9.io/ea0723/4thtwrx
* in the top menubar, click run project 
* next, click Preview > Preview with Web Server
* this will open a new tab within this frame - you can break it into a new browser tab by clicking the pop-out icon on the top-right of the url bar.

Alternatively, please unzip this tar.gz file and open with RubyMine, Sublime Text, or a similar IDE.

Enjoy and thank you for the opportunity to create something fun and challenging!

Following is a brief explanation of my design and assumptions:
While this design is not flashy, I made it as intuitive as possible without too 
many assumptions as to the general audience.

After the latest financial collapse, I've decided to give up on finding economic 
security on Earth. Luckily, the scant sum of money that was left in my account, 
was just enough for me to become an intergalactic entrepreneur. I rented a 
spaceship, left earth, and now make a living flying all over the galaxy selling 
common metals and dirt (which, apparently, is worth a lot).

However, buying and selling across the galaxy requires that I am able to convert 
numbers and units, and I've decided to write a program to do this (possibly, my 
knowledge of intergalactic currency conversions will ultimately offer Earth the 
opportunity to regain some economic standing and join the Galactic Council).

I've discovered that the numbers used for intergalactic transactions follow a 
similar convention to the roman numerals and I have painstakingly collected the 
appropriate translation between them.

I ensured my code was as dry and simple as possible
